## Description
---
A full-stack implementation of a Google Books Search.  All API requests were converted from RESTful API calls to GraphQL queries and mutations.  Users create an account, sign in, then search for a book.  Once a desired book is found, the user may save it to their profile for later reference.  Users may also delete books from their account when no longer needed.
    

    
## Installation
---
The live app can be used at http://shawnlittrel-library-search.herokuapp.com


    
## Usage
---
Create an account, log in, then search for books!  Your books will be  saved in a database for the next time you log in.
